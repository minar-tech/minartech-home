      <ul>
        <li>Initiate a Project</li>

        <li>Curate a
          Theme</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The MinarTech project is focused on <strong>Themes</strong>.
        Each Theme is a <strong>Narrative</strong> based on <strong>Digitized Primary
          Sources</strong>. Thus, Themes are more than a compilations or renderings of
        these sources as such.</p>
      <p>Thematic presentations are constructed by
        <strong>Curators</strong>, who are specialists in their respective fields, but
        <strong>Contributions</strong> to themes can be submitted to the Curator by
        anyone with access to primary sources, other material, or information.</p>
      <p>Themes are modular. A <strong>Module</strong> is initially used as a part of
        one Theme, but they can be reused in the context of other themes. MinarTech
        projects are <strong>Community Driven</strong>, but they are not an instance of
        Social Media. You can initiate a Theme or contribute to an existing one. If you
        want to submit a material, be in contact with the Curator for the Theme you are
        interested in. A list of Themes will be provided here, but remember that you can
        initiate your own Themes.</p>
      <p>Your Contribution can be
        <strong>Unverified</strong> or <strong>Reviewed</strong> by experts. If you want
        to be accepted as a <strong>Reviewer</strong>, please let us know what your
        specialities are. To be accepted as a Reviewer for a specific Theme, you are
        required to have academic credentials and peer reviewed publications of your
        own.</p>
      <p>As many of those writing texts for the service are not writing in
        their primary language, there is a need for <strong>Translation</strong>,
        <strong>Language Control</strong> and <strong>Revision</strong>. You are welcome
        to participate in this role for you own language.</p>
      <p>Skills and
        contributions of Web Developers are welcome, including
        <strong>Designers</strong>, <strong>Illustrators</strong> and <strong>Technical
          Developers</strong>.</p>
