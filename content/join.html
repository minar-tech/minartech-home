    <p>The MinarTech project is focused on <strong>Themes</strong>. Each Theme is a <strong>Narrative</strong> based on based on <strong>Digitized Primary Sources</strong>. Thus, Themes are more than a compilations or renderings of these sources as such.</p>
    <p>Themes are compliled by <strong>Curators</strong>, who are specialists in their respective fields, but <strong>Contributions</strong> to themes can be submited to the Curator by anyone with access to primary sources, other material, or information.</p>
    <p>Themes are modular. A <strong>Module</strong> is initially used as a part of one Theme, but they can be reused in the context of other themes. MinarTech projects are <strong>Community Driven</strong>, but they are not an instance of Social Media. You can initiate a Theme or contribute to an existing one. If you want to submit a material, be in contact with the Curator for the Theme you are interested in. A list of Themes wil be provided here, but remember that you can initiate your own Theme.</p>
    <p>Your Contribution can be <strong>Unverified</strong> or <strong>Reviewed</strong> by experts. If you want to be accepted as a <strong>Reviewer</strong>, please let us know what your specialities are. To be accepted as a Reviewer for a specific Theme, you are required to have academic credentials and peer reviewed publications of your own.</p>
    <p>As many of those writing texts for the service are not writing in their primary language, there is a need for <strong>Translation</strong>, <strong>Language Conrol</strong> and <strong>Revision</strong>. You are welcome to participate in this role for you own language.</p>
