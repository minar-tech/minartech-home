      <div class="maintext-intro"> Digital Publishing for Researchers and Curators.
        Rediscovering the original ideas of the WWW.</div>
      <div class="maintext-body">
        <p>The concept and project of
          <strong>Uncomplicated Web Publishing (UWP)</strong> emerged as a subproject
          of a broader project, <strong>Digital Support for Learning and Teaching
            Hindi, Urdu, and Persian</strong>. The original purpose of UWP is to receive
          and publish texts in Hindi, Urdu, and Persian in their respective writing
          systems, contributed by students, teachers, and researchers. The underlying
          assumption has been that they typically don't have the time and interest to
          delve into depths of technical systems. The same assumption has been made
          about curators in Cultural Heritage institutions. UWP is a set of practices
          and templates that has emerged as the result of a long process of experience
          and exploration. This web site is produced and run with UWP.</p>
        <p>The UWP claims to be a return to the original purpose of the World Wide Web: to
          enable reachers to organize and share information with a simple system that
          they can manage themselves.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Features of UWP are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>self-contained</strong> collection of
            <strong>static files</strong> associated with client side JavaScript. A UWP
            site is not dependent on an underlying technical platform such as a Content
            Management System. A consequence of this is that the complete site can, if
            needed, be saved and stored on a memory stick. A further consequence is
            that the site can be copied and run on an institutional web server, web
            hosting service, or cloud service without installation of any computer
            programs or systems. The system comes bundled with a portable HTTP web
            server that makes it possible to run the site on a local laptop or
            similar.<br> </li>
          <li>Contributions to the site can be submitted in
            <strong>markdown</strong> format. While the term "markdown" may sound
            intimidating, in its most simple form, a markdown text is plain text where
            paragraphs are separated by empty lines. Markdown consists of a limited set
            of tags that can be added to the text to indicate headings, subheadings,
            making a part of the text bold or italic etc., but a text can well be
            submitted without any additional formatting.</li>
          <li>A UWP site is modular,
            dynamic and responsive. <strong>Modular</strong> means, that there is a
            separation of content and form. Content is contributed as separate files
            included in a template. In a site it is possible to have several templates
            that have different forms, i.e. different structure and design. The
            separation between content and form means that responsibility for design
            can be given to a graphical designer, and that researchers and curators can
            focus on content. <strong>Dynamic</strong> functionality enables modularity
            and also makes the template adaptable. Modularity and dynamic functionality
            are both enabled by JavaScript. <strong>Responsive</strong> means that that
            the site adapts to different screen sizes of different devices. Responsivity
            is implemented with minimal, targeted solutions without the use of bloated
            libraries.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Key Value</h2>
        <p>In the background of the UWP
          there are two drivers, that reach far beyond the immediate needs of any
          single project:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first driver is the interest to develop
            <strong>Thematic Services</strong> for Cultural Heritage. The UWP system
            enables subject matter experts to write contributions that can be assembled
            to such services.</li>
          <li>The second driver is a recurring observation that
            <strong>complex applications have a limited life-span</strong>. When key
            technical actors withdraw from a project, technical systems get outdated, or
            some key resources become unavailable, the service dies. With it, the data
            contained in the system becomes unavailable. The modularity of the UWP
            system separates content from design, as well as from the scripts.
            The core data, that has been submitted as simple text files, remains
            accessible at all times and can be persistently stored. The visual templates
            are also very clean and simple, making it possible to transfer the site to
            some other system, if that is desired. </li>
