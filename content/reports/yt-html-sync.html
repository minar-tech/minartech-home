            GitHub</a></p>
        <p>Functions for synchronizing a
          YouTube video with HTML-pages that are shown in a parallel iframe are
          provided by YouTube's IFrame player API (Application Program Interface).
          Documentation for the API can be found at &nbsp;<span class="fas
    fa-external-link-square-alt"></span><a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">YouTube's documentation</a> for the
          IFrame Player API. By following the provided documentation it is possible to
          arrive to a functionality where the HTML page in a iframe changes when the
          video reaches a specific timestamp. What is not provided out of the box is
          the capability to randomly show the correct page when a user clicks at a
          specific point on the timeline. In this project, <strong>Synchronizing
            YouTube video with HTML</strong>, the missing capability has now been
          provided by JavaScript functions.</p>
        <p> In order to make this function
          accessible to students and teachers in a way that they can contribute to the
          content, the video module has to be integrated with a publication system.
          Additionally, the publication system has to be such that it is manageable
          for contributors who don't have the time or interest to delve into technical
          complexities For this reason a new publication system has been developed
          specifically for academic use as a parallel, separate project. This system,
          called <strong>Uncomplicated Web Publishing (UWP)</strong>, is modeled after
          the original World Wide Web, that was developed for researchers, and was
          based on static HTML pages. This site is created with UWP. The features of
          UWP are described in a separate <span class="fas fa-file-alt"></span><a href="/t1.html?p=reports/uwp">report</a>. A complementing project has been
          initiated to enable scaling of the UPW using Node.js and Docker
          containers.</p>
        <p>Here, on the MinarTech site, there are separate pages
          reserved for playlists of Hindi, Urdu and Persian videos. These playlists are a
          part of the various <span class="fas fa-link"></span><a href="/t1.html?p=resources">resources</a> that will over time be accumulated on the
          site as a part of
          international co-operaton. Texts in their respective writing systems along
          with their translations can be contributed as plain text files or,
          optionally, with added formatting in the simple Markdown formatting language.</p>
