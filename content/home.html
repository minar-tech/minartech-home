    <p>MinarTech is an Incubator for International, Community Driven Projects aiming
      at Curated, Thematic Services for Cultural Heritage based on Digitized Primary
      Sources. Such <span class="fas fa-link"></span><a href="t1.html?p=resources">Resources</a> include Digitized Image Collections,
      Digitized Manuscripts, Open Access Datasets, and Open Source Code. We also
      facilitate supporting projects involving Language Technology and Machine
      Learning.</p>

    <div class="caption">The
      word "Minar" is common to Arabic, Persian and Hindi. Its original meaning is
      "place of light", i.e. lighthouse, but in a more generic sense it means "tower".
      The word "minaret" is one of its acuired meanings. The MinarTech Logo symbolizes
      a tower made up of two triangles. The base of the triangle is made up of the
      three fundamental tasks of Universities: Learning, Teaching and Research. The
      upper triangle, with Innovation, Culture and Engagement, is supported by the
      base. Without them, Learning, Teaching and Research have very little, if any,
      meaning. The two triangles are tied together in the centre by international
      co-operation. Without it the construction collapses.</div>
    <p>The outcome of
      MinarTech Projects will be published in their respective, separate Project
      Sites. Prototypes may be published here. Code and Resources of will be shared on
      GitHub. Co-operation between Technical Developers and Curators will be
      facilitated using the Discourse forum software.</p>
    <p>The MinarTech Project and
      Site is in an early phase of development. We follow the principle of Continuous
      Integration and Development (CI/CD) which means that we are continuously on the
      move. <span class="fas fa-link"></span><a href="t1.html?p=join">Join</a> us and
