        The word &quot;Minar&quot; is common to Arabic, Persian and Hindi. Its original meaning is &quot;place of light&quot;, i.e. lighthouse, but in a more generic sense it means &quot;tower&quot;. The word &quot;minaret&quot; is one of its
        acquired meanings. The MinarTech logo symbolizes a tower made up of two triangles. The base of the triangle is consists of the three fundamental tasks of universities: Learning, Teaching and Research. The upper triangle, with Innovation,
        Culture and Engagement, is supported by the base. Without them, Learning, Teaching and Research have very little, if any, meaning. The two triangles are tied together in the center by international co-operation. Without it the construction
        collapses.

      <p>The outcome of MinarTech Projects will be published in their respective, separate project sites. Prototypes may be published here. Code and Resources of will be shared on GitHub. Co-operation between technical developers and curators will be
        facilitated using the Discourse forum software.</p>
      <p>The MinarTech project and site is in an early phase of development. We follow the principle of Continuous Integration and Development (CI/CD) which means that we are continuously on the move. <span class="fas fa-link"></span><a
