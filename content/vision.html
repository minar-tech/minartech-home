        <p>The MinarTech Projects aims to present Culture and History on
          the Web as narratives (stories) based on digitized primary
          sources. The presentation is built around <strong>Themes</strong>.
          A Thematic presentation can be compared to an exhibition in a
          museum. However, differing from museums, the presentations are
          not dismantled after a period of time, but refined,
          complemented and <strong>Resused</strong>, forming a
          persistent, evolving and cumulating resource.</p>
        <p>The thematic presentations form narratives, i.e. <strong>Stories</strong>.
          For any historical event, there is not just one single story,
          but all participants have their own. The MinarTech approach
          aims to give a voice to these multiple stories without
          prejudice. It is required, that the stories are authentic.
          Similarily, cultural phenomena are experienced and interpreted
          differently by different actors. The MinarTech approach also
          aims to give a voice to different experiences and
          interpretations.</p>
        <p>Culture on the Web is increasingly structured as <strong>Linked

            Data</strong>, implemented by leading Cultural Heritage
          institutions in large scale projects. The MinarTech approach
          attempts to take a step further: To create <strong>Linked
            Stories</strong> based on Linked Data.</p>
