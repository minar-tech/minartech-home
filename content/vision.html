From Linked Data to Linked Stories
</div>
<div class="maintext-body">
<p>The MinarTech Projects aims to present culture and history on the Web as narratives (stories) based on digitized primary sources. The presentation is built around <strong>Themes</strong>. A Thematic presentation can be compared to an exhibition in a museum. However, differing from museums, the presentations are not dismantled after a period of time, but refined, complemented and <strong>Reused</strong>, forming a persistent, evolving and cumulative resource.</p>
<p>The thematic presentations form narratives, i.e. <strong>Stories</strong>. For any historical event, there is not just one single story, but all participants have their own. The MinarTech approach aims to give a voice to these multiple stories without prejudice. It is required, that the stories are authentic. Similarly, cultural phenomena are experienced and interpreted differently by different actors. The MinarTech approach also aims to give a voice to different experiences and interpretations.</p>
<p>Culture on the Web is increasingly structured as <strong>Linked Data</strong>, implemented by leading Cultural Heritage institutions in large scale projects. The MinarTech approach attempts to take a step further: To create <strong>Linked Stories</strong> based on Linked Data.</p>
