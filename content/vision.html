  <div class="maintext-body">
    <p>The MinarTech Projects aims to present Culture and
      History on the Web as narratives (stories) based on digitized primary sources.
      The presentation is built around Themes. A Thematic presentation can be compared
      to an exhibition in a museum. However, differing from museums, the presentations
      are not dismantled after a period of time, but refined, complemented and
      resused, forming a persistent, evolving and cumulating resource.</p>
    <p>The
      thematic presentations form narratives, i.e. stories. For any historical event,
      there is not just one single story, but all paritipants have their own. The
      MinarTech approach aims to give a voice to these multiple stories without
      prejudice. It is required, that the stories are authentic. Similarily, cultural
      phenomena are experienced and interpreted differently by different actors. The
      MinarTech approach also aims to give a voice to different experiences and
      interpretations.</p>
    <p>Culture on the Web is increasingly structured as Linked
      Data, implemented by leading Cultural Heritage institutions in large scale
      projects. The MinarTech approach attempts to take a step further: To create
      Linked Stories based on Linked Data.</p>
